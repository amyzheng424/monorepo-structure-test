## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

Welcome to the development guide for our Monorepo Angular project that combines the power of Capacitor for native app development and Tailwind CSS for styling. This guide will help you set up the project, run applications, and add new ones to the Monorepo.

## What is a Monorepo?<a name="what-is-a-monorepo"></a>

A Monorepo (Monolithic Repository) is a version control system where multiple projects or components are stored in a single repository. We chose this approach to simplify project management and code sharing among different applications.

## What is Capacitor?<a name="what-is-capacitor"></a>

Capacitor is a cross-platform native runtime that allows you to build web-based applications and deploy them as native apps on multiple platforms. In our project, we use Capacitor to bridge the gap between our Angular app and native device features.

## What is Tailwind CSS?<a name="what-is-tailwind-css"></a>

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes styling easy and highly customizable. It's a fundamental part of our project for creating beautiful and responsive user interfaces.

## Getting Started<a name="getting-started"></a>
